## Running the script

Enter into the Yelp file and execute the Python script.
yelp_upload.csv is a CSV file with keyword search term column and location column. 
yelp_results.csv is a CSV file with results from the search

Keyword search term is defined by Yelp as: Search term (e.g. "food", "restaurants"). If term isnâ€™t included we search everything. The term keyword also accepts business names such as "Starbucks".
Location is defined by Yelp as: Specifies the combination of "address, neighborhood, city, state or zip, optional country" to be used when searching for businesses.

Please make sure this information is not blank for the script to work
```
python yelp.py
```

## Limitations
Yelp imposes a limit of 50 results per request and 1,000 results hard limit. Radius is also limited to 40,000 meters (25 miles) from the location requested
